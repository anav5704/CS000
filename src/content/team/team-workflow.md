# Team Workflow

Let's discuss how you and your group members will work together. So at this basic level, we will not touch `Git branches`. They are very powerful, provided you can use it without nuking your entire project. It will be covered in the CS000 pro lesson.

# Roles

There will be 2 main roles when working in a group. The first is of the project `owner` and the second is of the `contributor`.

## Owner

This is the person that will `create` the repository for the assignment on GitHub. They will also add some starter code to give your group members a base to work from. This can include adding the `main` function along with the `header` files and `constants` required.

If you decide to be the owner, your main role will be to `merge` the `pull requests` from the contributors. This is basically letting other peoples code into your repo. You won't have to `merge` your own code as you own the repo.

## Contributors

These are the people that will `fork` and `clone` the assignment repo. They will get their own copy of the main assignment code that is still linked to the original repo.

If you decide to be a contributor, your main role will be to `sync` your forked repo with the original repo. Along with this, you will need to `pull` the latest code from the original repo. After adding features, you will have to create a `pull request` to add your code to the main repo.
