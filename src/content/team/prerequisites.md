# Prerequisites

CS000 is designed to be as beginner-friendly as possible. No previous knowledge on Git, GitHub, or the command line is required. There are still a few things that a required before you can start.

## A Computer

Any working computer or laptop will do. It will be better if you own it as you will need to log into a few different accounts. No particular specifications are required, just an internet connection. I run a Windows 11 machine and will provide corresponding instructions for MacOS. If you are on Linux then you shouldn't be here.

## Text Editor

Both Git and GitHub work independently of the text editor, so it doesn't matter which one you use. I will be using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) in this course. If you are a USP student, you can continue to use [Bloodshed Dev C++](https://bloodshed.net/devcpp.html).

## CS000 Solo

This lesson builds on the concepts covered in [CS000 Solo](https://cs000.anav.dev/lessons/solo/introduction). If you already have familiarity with the basics of Git and GitHub, you can skip this lesson. Basic terminal knowledge is also required, primarily navigation and running commands.
