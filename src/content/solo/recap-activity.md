# Recap Activity

Firstly, congratulations on completing the previous chapters. You are now ready to daily drive Git as a solo developer.
To help you gain familiarity, I have one homework assignment for you.

# Organize Projects

You probably have a few projects lying around from previous semesters. I want you first move them all into the `code` directory we had created. Put them in subdirectories based on specific relationships if applicable. Something like this:

```ts
code
├── CS000
│   ├── math.cpp
│   ├── math.cpp
│   └── .gitignore
├── CS111
│   ├── project1.cpp
│   └── project1.exe
└── CS112
    ├── project1.cpp
    └── project1.exe
```

# Migrate Projects

Now, go and create GitHub repositories for each of the projects. Once you do that, use the terminal to go into each directory push the code to GitHub.
