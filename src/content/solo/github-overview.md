In addition to this, GitHub can be used as a portfolio for your projects. GitHub is well known and has magnificent SEO so if you document your projects properly, you can get a lot of exposure. This will be covered in the bonus lessons.

# Create Account

## Stars Tab

Stars are GitHub's way of bookmarking repos. Stars are more than just that though. They are taken pretty seriously. The more stars a repo has, the more likely it is to be discovered by other developers. They are also a way of validating the authenticity of a repo.
