# Pro Workflow

Let's discuss how you and your group members will work together. We are now working at a much more advanced level of Git. We will be dealing with Git `branches` and `workflows`.

# Roles

Just as in the team workflow, there will be 2 main roles when working in a group in the pro workflow. The first is of the project `owner` and the second is of the `contributor`. The main difference this time is that instead of forking and pushing to the assignment repo directly, we will be working with branches.

## Owner

This is the person that will `create` the repository for the assignment on GitHub. They will also add some starter code to give your group members a base to work from. This can include adding the `main` function along with the `header` files and `constants` required.

If you decide to be the owner, your main role will be to `merge` the contributors `branches` into the `main` branch. This is basically letting other peoples code into your repo. You will also have to create a `branch` for yourself for each feature you add.

## Contributors

These are the people that will `fork` and `clone` the assignment repo. They will get their own copy of the main assignment code that is still linked to the original repo. They won't directly work on the repo itself, but rather on their own `branches`.

If you decide to be a contributor, your main role will be to `sync` your forked repo with the original repo. Along with this, you will need to `pull` the latest code from the original repo and `merge` it into your `branch`. After adding features, you will have to create a `pull request` to `merge` your branch into the main repo.
