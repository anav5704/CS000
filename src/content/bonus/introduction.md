# Introduction

This lesson is for the handful of people that wanted to go the extra mile and learn more about Git and GitHub. You will not learn any new Git or GitHub features here. You will only learn how to use them faster and get the most out of them. I will also include some lesser-known tips and tricks that I picked up during my year of using Git and GitHub.

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Be faster and more efficient with Git
-   Set up a GitHub profile README
-   Write documentation using Markdown
