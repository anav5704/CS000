# Introduction

This lesson is for the handful of people that had wanted to go the extra mile and learn more about Git and GitHub. You will not learn any new Git or GitHub functionality here. Only how to use them faster and the most use out of them. I will also include some lesser know tips and tricks that I picked up in my single year of using Git and GitHub.

# Learning Outcomes

By the end of this lesson, you will be able to:

-   Be faster and more efficient with Git
-   Set up a GitHub profile README
-   Write documentation using Markdown
